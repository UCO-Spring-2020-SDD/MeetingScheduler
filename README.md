## Installation

Here are some good resources for building and running the project.

- [For macOS](https://medium.com/@diwassharma/starting-a-python-django-project-on-mac-os-x-c089165cf010)
- [For Windows](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/howto/windows/)
- [For Linux](http://hampton.website/linux/django/)

If at any point during this process you have trouble with `pip` or `python` not being recgonized commands, you must add them to your `$PATH` variable. (Or, if you're on Windows, the `%PATH%` variable.)
